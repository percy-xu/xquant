# xquant

## What?

`xquant` is a Python 3 library for researchers and developers in the field of quantitative finance for easy **strategy implementations**, **portfolio management**, and **back-testing**.

## Why?

If over-simplified, quantitative finance can be divided into 2 steps:

1. coming up with an idea
2. implementing this idea and see if it works (i.e. generates profits)

`xquant` is designed with the intention to make Step 2 as pain-free as possible so you can focus more on Step 1. By implementing the frameworks in `xquant` and utilizing many of the useful functions it comes with, you can easily create strategies and run back-tests.

In essence, `xquant` allows you to code less and think more.
